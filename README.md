ManageIQ plugin for the Redfish provider.

## Quickstart

Redfish provider is installed by default when setting up ManageIQ development
environment. To start using it, navigate to the `Compute` ->
`Physical Infrastructure` -> `Providers` and add new provider of type Redfish.

## Development

See the section on plugins in the [ManageIQ Developer Setup](http://manageiq.org/docs/guides/developer_setup/plugins)

For quick local setup run `bin/setup`, which will clone the core ManageIQ repository under the *spec* directory and setup necessary config files. If you have already cloned it, you can run `bin/update` to bring the core ManageIQ code up to date.

### Mock Server

A useful tool to be able to develop the Redfish provider is the mock
Redfish server. And fortunately for us, it has been already installed as a
part of an initial setup. We just need to get our hands on some recordings and
we are good to go.

One recording is available in [XLAB's repo][redfish-recordings]. We can clone
it and instruct mock server to serve it:

    $ ( cd ~/miq && git clone https://github.com/xlab-si/redfish-recordings )
    $ bundle exec redfish serve ../redfish-recordings/lenovo-sr650

                         (XLAB's repo with Redfish recordings)
